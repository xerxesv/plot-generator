- do front end
	- design/visuals
	- some kind of basic error handling/dealing if it cant load the fields
	- clicking on a single box loads new data for just that field ( error handling above can also use this to deal with individual fields not loading, use for loop instead of .each() probably)

- deploy somewhere other than heroku (maybe nanobox.io)


- serve front end following o embed (?) protocol from server? 
	- or: just include the frontend code as html in squarespace (no.)

- deploy somewhere other than heroku
